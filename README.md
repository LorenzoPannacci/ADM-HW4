This repository contains the submission of Group #19 of the fourth homework for the course "Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining", Academic year 2023â€“2024.
Here we provide the link for an easier access to the notebook: https://nbviewer.org/github/LorenzoPannacci/ADM-HW4/blob/main/main.ipynb

As some parts of the code are more discursive we haven't moved everything to separate `.py` modules to not break the reading flow of the reader.
